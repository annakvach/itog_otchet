# Obtain data

There are two options how to obtain data: with help of Sratoolkit and simle bash code or manually from EBLM-EBI. 

## Sratoolkit + simple bash 

Using this method, we created a simple bash program that receives a file with sra identifiers as input. Our code uses the prefetch and fastq-dump programs from the Sratoolkit package, and as a result downloads forward and backward reads.


First of all we created a .txt file with all sra id on each line.

```{bash, eval=F, echo=T}
SRR11096622
SRR11096623
SRR11096624
SRR11096625
SRR11096626
SRR11096627
SRR11096628
SRR11096629
SRR11096630
SRR11096631
SRR11096632
SRR11096633
SRR11096634
SRR11096635
SRR11096636
SRR11096637
SRR11096638
SRR11096639
SRR11096640
```



After that sra_dowload_with_sratoolkit.sh was create.  

```{bash, sra_dowload_with_sratoolkit, eval=F, echo=T}
#!/bin/bash  
# for SRA files downloading with help of sratoolkit                                           
FILE=$1                            
while read id                      
do                                 
prefetch $id                       
echo "for $id prefetch done"       
fastq-dump --split-files --split-3 ${id}.sra
echo "for $id fastq-dump done"     
done < $FILE
```

And after that:

```{bash, eval=F, echo=T}
sra_dowload_with_sratoolkit.sh sra_id.txt

```


## Directly and manually from EBLM-EBI

Also data can be obtained directly and manually from EBLM-EBI - <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA607082>. 

You should dowload forward and revers reads. Files with forward reads have "_1" prefix (for ex. SRR11096622_1.fastq.gz) and files with reverse reads have "_2" prefix (for ex. SRR11096622_2.fastq.gz). Files with no prefix are files of the remaining unpaired reads, and we will not use them.
